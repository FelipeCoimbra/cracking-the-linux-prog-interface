Experiment results:

```console
vagrant@vagrant:/vagrant/c$ ls -lsh ~/out*
2.0M -rw-rw-r-- 1 vagrant vagrant 2.0M Jun 20 19:07 /home/vagrant/out1
988K -rw-rw-r-- 1 vagrant vagrant 987K Jun 20 19:07 /home/vagrant/out2
```

When writing with a descriptor with the `O_APPEND` flag (`out1`), the operation is done atomically and each process writes 1MB of data successfully.

When writing without the `O_APPEND` flag, there is a race condition between the 2 processes.
In particular, if process A `lseek`s the end of the file and then process B writes to the end of the file, process A overwrites process B's data.
This causes the file not to grow in size, and thus we have a smaller file size in the end.

Actually, since 987K/1MB ~ 48.19% we can say roughly half of the writes suffered from race conditions in this experiment.

NOTE: 988K is the real number of storage blocks occupied in the storage device.
