```c
fd1 = open(file, O_RDWR | O_CREAT | O_TRUNC, S_IRUSR | S_IWUSR); // File is empty initially
fd2 = dup(fd1);
fd3 = open(file, O_RDWR);
write(fd1, "Hello,", 6); // Size: 6B, Content: "Hello,"
write(fd2, "world", 6); // Size 11B, Content: "Hello,world"
lseek(fd2, 0, SEEK_SET);
write(fd1, "HELLO,", 6); // Size 11B, Content: "HELLO,world"
write(fd3, "Gidday", 6); // Size 11B, Content: "Giddayworld"
```

- `fd1` and `fd2` share the same file offset, so the writing of "world" happens after "Hello," and using `lseek` to point `fd2` to the beginning of the file also changes `fd1`'s offset.
- `fd3` points to a different entry in the open file table and the previous operations don't influence its offset. It writes to the beginning of the file.
