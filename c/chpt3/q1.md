Very weird at first, the *reboot(2)* system call [is issued via](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/reboot.2.html):

```c
    int syscall(SYS_reboot, int magic, int magic2, int cmd, void *arg);
```
Here, `SYS_reboot` is used by the kernel to identify the system call being invoked, `magic`  and `magic2` are "magic numbers",
`cmd` specifies the type of reboot and `arg` an optional argument used if `cmd` is `LINUX_REBOOT_CMD_RESTART2`.

Magic numbers are just constants. The reboot function will reject the call if `magic` is not equal to `LINUX_REBOOT_MAGIC1`(which is expanded to 0xfee1dead), and `magic2` is not equal to `LINUX_REBOOT_MAGIC2` (expanded to 672274793). `magic2` also accepts 85072278, 369367448, and 537993216.

If you turn these 4 decimal numbers into hex, you end up with **28121969**, **5121996**, **16041998** and **20112000**.
Reading those as dates in the dd/mm/yyyy format, you get the birthdates of Linus Torvalds' and his three children.

lol

Fun aside, the magic numbers work as a clever break system: if by any reason, such as a hardware failure, even a single bit is wrongly flipped and a syscall code is turned into `SYS_reboot`, the computer won't reboot suddenly and cause important data to be lost or a critical functionality to go offline.

Imagine if an aircraft module reboots suddenly because of a goddamn gamma ray from outer space.
