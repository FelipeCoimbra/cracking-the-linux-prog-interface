This question [has been redacted](https://man7.org/tlpi/errata/) because it is flawed.
The new question is:

        8-1. When we execute the following code, which attempts to display the usernames for two different user IDs, 
        we find that it displays the same username twice. Why is this? 
```c
printf("%s %s\n", getpwuid(uid1)->pw_name, getpwuid(uid2)->pw_name);
```

For example, [our code](q1.md):
```c
void chpt8_q1() {
    printf("%s %s\n", 
        getpwuid(0)->pw_name, // root user
        getpwuid(1)->pw_name // daemon user
    );
}
```

Outputs:
```console
vagrant@vagrant:/vagrant/c$ run c8 q1
root root
```

The reason for this is because the getpw***() functions store their resuts in statically allocated memory.
Though this takes away the need for the caller or the callee to allocate memory in the heap or stack, this means that consecutive calls overwrite the same
memory space, making the function non-reentrant.
As the manual says:

       The getpwnam() and getpwuid() functions return a pointer to a
       passwd structure, or NULL if the matching entry is not found or
       an error occurs.  If an error occurs, errno is set to indicate
       the error.  If one wants to check errno after the call, it should
       be set to zero before the call.

       The return value may point to a static area, and may be
       overwritten by subsequent calls to getpwent(3), getpwnam(), or
       getpwuid().  (Do not pass the returned pointer to free(3).)

Because the x86-64 ABI evaluates function arguments from last to first, the `getpwuid(0)` call overwrites the result of `getpwuid(1)` and the `struct passwd *` contents refer to the root user.
