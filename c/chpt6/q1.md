Because `char globBuf[65536]` is defined globally, in C it defaults to a static variable.
However, since the variable is uninitialized, the executable file only holds the numeric value for the amount of bytes it needs to allocate at load time and not the actual allocated memory.
At executable loading time, the alloted memory is allocated in the Uninitialized Data Segment (bss) segment.

This would be different if the variable was a `const char[65536]` with its value defined at compile time.
In this situation, the value would be stored in the executable file, and the file would size in the order of 10MB.
At load time, the variable would be copied to the Initialized Data segment of the process' virtual address space.
